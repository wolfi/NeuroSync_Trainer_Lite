# NeuroSync Trainer Lite

## Overview

**NeuroSync Trainer Lite** is a tool for training an **audio-to-face blendshape transformer model**, enabling the generation of facial animation from audio input. This is useful for real-time applications like **virtual avatars, game characters, and animation pipelines**.

## Features
- **Audio-Driven Facial Animation** – Train a model to generate realistic blendshape animations from audio input.
- **Multi-GPU Support** – Train efficiently using up to 4 GPUs.
- **Integration with Unreal Engine** – Send trained animation data to Unreal Engine via **NeuroSync Local API** and **NeuroSync Player**.
- **Optimized for iPhone Face Data** – Easily process facial motion capture data from an iPhone.

## Quick Start
### 1. Install Dependencies
Before training, ensure you have the required dependencies installed, including:
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch with CUDA support (for GPU acceleration)
- NumPy, Pandas, Librosa, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and other required Python libraries
- FFMPEG for linux should be installed globally, Windows users need to get a built ffmpeg.exe and put it inside utils\video\ _ffmpeg\bin to correctly strip the audio from the .mov in the face data folders....

### 2. Collect & Prepare Data
To train the model, you need audio and calibrated facial blendshape data. 

**Ensure you 'calibrate' in the LiveLink app before you record your data. This ensures your resting face is 0 or close to 0 in all dimensions.**

Follow these steps:
1. **Record Face & Audio Data** using an iPhone and LiveLink app utilizing **ARKit Blendshapes** as the type of data collected (not depth data).
2. **Download & Extract the Data** to your local machine.
3. **Move Data to the Correct Folder:**
   - Place each extracted folder inside `dataset/data/`.

### 3. Train the Model
Once your data is ready, start training by running:
```bash
python train.py
```

## Multi-GPU Training
If you want to train using multiple GPUs, update the **configuration file**:
1. Open `config.py`.
2. Set `use_multi_gpu = True`.
3. Define the number of GPUs:
   ```python
   'use_multi_gpu': True,
   'num_gpus': 4  # Adjust as needed, max 4 GPUs
   ```
4. Start training as usual.

You can easily modify the code to support **more than 4 GPUs**—just ask ChatGPT for assistance!

## Using the NeuroSync Model
To **generate facial blendshapes from audio** and send them to Unreal Engine, you'll need:
- [**NeuroSync Local API**](https://github.com/AnimaVR/NeuroSync_Local_API) – Handles real-time facial data processing.
- [**NeuroSync Player**](https://github.com/AnimaVR/NeuroSync_Player) – Sends the animation data to Unreal Engine or any **LiveLink-compatible** software.
